# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Telecom customer churn is the phenomenon of customers leaving a telecom service provider and switching to a competitor. It is a crucial metric for any telecom company as it directly affects the revenue and market share of a telecom company. Therefore, it is essential for telecom companies to understand why their customers are churning and take appropriate measures to prevent it.

Objective: The objective of the project is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rate.

Data Collection:
The first step in the project is to collect data related to customer demographics, usage behavior, plan details, and customer churn history. Generally, this data is collected from various sources like the company's CRM system, billing system, customer feedback surveys, and social media But for the purpose of this project, I took dataset from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Once the data is collected, the next step in the process is to clean and prepare it for analysis. This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, outliers and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
The next step is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and trends in the data. This includes visualizing data using graphs and charts and calculating statistical measures like mean, median, interquartile range and standard deviation. 

Feature Selection:
Based on EDA, we can identify the features that are most correlated with customer churn. For example, we may find that customers who are on a high-value plan and use a lot of data are less likely to churn. On the other hand, customers who frequently call customer service and complain are more likely to churn.
